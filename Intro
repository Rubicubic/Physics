Hello everyone, I am an unprofessional physicist who wanna solve some interesting problems in Physics.
Along the way of coming up with solutions, I would like to record all the efforts including mistakes I make and share them with you guys.
Maybe in the end, some problems cannot be solved by my limited knowledge. If so, it would be quite appreciated should anyone give me a hint or whatever to help.
P.S. I am fron China, and my English is far from good, especially when it comes to technical vocabulary. So should there be any awkward expressions, please be tolerating and, it is quite welcome to point them out.
Thanks a lot and may the force be with you ^_^
